\section{Overview}

Generating random numbers is a quite common task in security software. In many cases, encryption keys
are not provided by users, but are instead generated inside the software. Their randomness is extremely
important; otherwise, attackers can predict the encryption key, and thus defeat the purpose of encryption.
Many developers know how to generate random numbers (e.g. for Monte Carlo simulation) from their
prior experiences, so they use the similar methods to generate the random numbers for security purpose.
Unfortunately, a sequence of random numbers may be good for Monte Carlo simulation, but they may be
bad for encryption keys. Developers need to know how to generate secure random numbers, or they will
make mistakes. Similar mistakes have been made in some well-known products, including Netscape and
Kerberos. \\
\tab In this lab, students will learn why the typical random number generation method is not appropriate
for generating secrets, such as encryption keys. They will further learn a standard way to generate pseudo
random numbers that are good for security purposes. This lab covers the following topics:


    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pseudo random number generation
        \item Mistakes in random number generation
        \item Generating encryption key
        \item The /dev/random and /dev/urandom device files
    \end{itemize}

\textbf{Lab Environment}. This lab has been tested on our pre-built Ubuntu 12.04 VM and Ubuntu 16.04 VM, both of which
can be downloaded from the SEED website.
